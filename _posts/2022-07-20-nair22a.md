title: 'Prospective Explanations: An Interactive Mechanism for Model Understanding'
abstract: We demonstrate a system for prospective explanations of black box models
  for regression and classification tasks with structured data. Prospective explanations
  are aimed at showing how models function by highlighting likely changes in model
  outcomes under changes in input. This in contrast to most post-hoc explanability
  methods, that aim to provide a justification for a decision retrospectively. To
  do so, we employ a surrogate Bayesian network model and learn dependencies through
  a structure learning task. Our system is designed to provide fast estimates of changes
  in outcomes for any arbitrary exploratory query from users. Such queries are typical
  partial, i.e. involve only a selected number of features, the outcomes labels are
  shown therefore as likelihoods. Repeated queries can indicate which aspects of the
  feature space are more likely to influence the target variable. We demonstrate the
  system from a real-world application from the humanitarian sector and show the value
  of bayesian network surrogates.
