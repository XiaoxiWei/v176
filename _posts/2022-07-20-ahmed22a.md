title: 'Pylon: A PyTorch Framework for Learning with Constraints'
abstract: 'Deep learning excels at learning low-level task information from large
  amounts of data, but struggles with learning high-level domain knowledge, which
  can often be directly and succinctly expressed. In this work, we introduce Pylon,
  a neuro-symbolic training framework that builds on PyTorch to augment procedurally
  trained neural networks with declaratively specified knowledge. Pylon allows users
  to programmatically specify <em>constraints<\em> as PyTorch functions, and compiles
  them into a differentiable loss, thus training predictive models that fit the data
  <em>whilst<\em> satisfying the specified constraints. Pylon includes both exact
  as well as approximate compilers to efficiently compute the loss, employing fuzzy
  logic, sampling methods, and circuits, ensuring scalability even to complex models
  and constraints. A guiding principle in designing Pylon has been the ease with which
  any existing deep learning codebase can be extended to learn from constraints using
  only a few lines: a function expressing the constraint and a single line of code
  to compile it into a loss. We include case studies from natural language processing,
  computer vision, logical games, and knowledge graphs, that can be interactively
  trained, and highlights Pylon{â€™}s usage.'
