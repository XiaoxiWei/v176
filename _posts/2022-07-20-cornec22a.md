title: 'AIMEE: Interactive model maintenance with rule-based surrogates'
abstract: In real-world applications, such as loan approvals or claims management,
  machine learn-ing (ML) models need to be updated or retrained to adhere to new rules
  and regulations.But how can a new model be built and new decision boundaries be
  formed without having new training data available? We present the AI Model Explorer
  and Editor tool (AIMEE) for model exploration and model editing using human understandable
  rules. It addresses the problem of changing decision boundaries by leveraging user-specified
  feedback rules that are used to pre-process training data such that a retrained
  model will reflect user changes.The pre-processing step uses synthetic oversampling
  and relabeling and assumes black-box access to the algorithm that retrains the model.
  AIMEE provides interactive methods to edit rule sets, visualize changes to decision
  boundaries, and generate interpretable comparisons of model changes so that users
  see their feedback reflected in the updated model. The demo shows an end-to-end
  solution that supports the full update lifecycle of an ML model.
