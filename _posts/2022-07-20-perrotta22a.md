title: The Second NeurIPS Tournament of Reconnaissance Blind Chess
abstract: Reconnaissance Blind Chess is an imperfect-information variant of chess
  with significant private information that challenges state-of-the-art algorithms.
  The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and several organizing partners
  held the second NeurIPS machine Reconnaissance Blind Chess competition in 2021.
  18 bots competed in 9,180 games, revealing a dominant champion with 91% wins. The
  top four bots in the tournament matched or exceeded the performance of the inaugural
  tournamentâ€™s winner. However, none of the algorithms converge to an optimal, unexploitable
  strategy or appear to have addressed the core research challenges associated with
  Reconnaissance Blind Chess.
