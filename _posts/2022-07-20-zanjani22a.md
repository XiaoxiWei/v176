title: Deep Learning Frameworks for Weakly-Supervised Indoor Localization
abstract: We present two weakly-supervised deep learning frameworks for person indoor
  localization through Wi-Fi signal. These two frameworks, namely OT-Isomap and WiCluster,
  in contrast with prior works, require only room/zone level labels that is easier
  to acquire, compared to hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. The
  OT-Isomap is a modality-agnostic model and formulates the localization problem in
  the context of parametric manifold learning and optimal transportation. This framework
  allows jointly learning a low-dimensional embedding as well as correspondences with
  a topological map. The WiCluster method is based on self-supervised deep clustering
  and metric learning models. Inspired by the deep cluster method, the Wi-Fi signals
  are spatially charted and represented in lower-dimensional space while a triplet
  margin-loss constrains an isometric representation of data on its 2D/3D intrinsic
  space. We demonstrate the meter-level accuracy of these two methods on both real-world
  Wi-Fi and camera-based indoor localization.
