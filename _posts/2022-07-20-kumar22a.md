title: Automated Evaluation of GNN Explanations with Neuro Symbolic Reasoning
abstract: Explaining Graph Neural Networks predictions to end users of AI applications
  in easily understandable terms remains an unsolved problem. In particular, we do
  not have well developed methods for automatically evaluating explanations, in ways
  that are closer to how users consume those explanations. Based on recent application
  trends and our own experiences in real world problems, we propose an automatic evaluation
  approach for GNN Explanations using Neuro Symbolic Reasoning.
