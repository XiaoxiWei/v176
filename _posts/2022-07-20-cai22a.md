title: Real-Time and Accurate Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation on Mobile
  Device
abstract: In this paper, we present our innovations on self-supervised monocular depth
  estimation. First, we enhance self-supervised monocular depth estimation with semantic
  information during training. This reduces the error by 12% and achieves state-of-the-art
  performance. Second, we enhance the backbone architecture using a scalable method
  for neural architecture search which optimizes directly for inference latency on
  a target device. This enables operation at more than 30 FPS. We demonstrate these
  techniques on a smartphone powered by a Snapdragon Mobile Platform.
