title: Evaluating Approximate Inference in Bayesian Deep Learning
abstract: 'Uncertainty representation is crucial to the safe and reliable deployment
  of deep learning. Bayesian methods provide a natural mechanism to represent epistemic
  uncertainty, leading to improved generalization and calibrated predictive distributions.
  Understanding the fidelity of approximate inference has extraordinary value beyond
  the standard approach of measuring generalization on a particular task: if approximate
  inference is working correctly, then we can expect more reliable and accurate deployment
  across any number of real-world settings. In this competition, we evaluate the fidelity
  of approximate Bayesian inference procedures in deep learning, using as a reference
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samples obtained by parallelizing computations over
  hundreds of tensor processing unit (TPU) devices. We consider a variety of tasks,
  including image recognition, regression, covariate shift, and medical applications.
  All data are publicly available, and we release several baselines, including stochastic
  MCMC, variational methods, and deep ensembles. The competition resulted in hundreds
  of submissions across many teams. The winning entries all involved novel multi-modal
  posterior approximations, highlighting the relative importance of representing multiple
  modes, and suggesting that we should not consider deep ensembles a {“}non-Bayesian{”}
  alternative to standard unimodal approximations. In the future, the competition
  will provide a foundation for innovation and continued benchmarking of approximate
  Bayesian inference procedures in deep learning. The HMC samples will remain available
  through the competition website.'
