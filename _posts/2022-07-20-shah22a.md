title: Retrospective on the 2021 MineRL BASALT Competition on Learning from Human
  Feedback
abstract: We held the first-ever MineRL Benchmark for Agents that Solve Almost-Lifelike
  Tasks (MineRL BASALT) Competition at the Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information
  Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021). The goal of the competition was to promote research
  towards agents that use learning from human feedback (LfHF) techniques to solve
  open-world tasks. Rather than mandating the use of LfHF techniques, we described
  four tasks in natural language to be accomplished in the video game Minecraft, and
  allowed participants to use any approach they wanted to build agents that could
  accomplish the tasks. Teams developed a diverse range of LfHF algorithms across
  a variety of possible human feedback types. The three winning teams implemented
  significantly different approaches while achieving similar performance. Interestingly,
  their approaches performed well on <em>different</em> tasks, validating our choice
  of tasks to include in the competition. While the outcomes validated the design
  of our competition, we did not get as many participants and submissions as our sister
  competition, MineRL Diamond. We speculate about the causes of this problem and suggest
  improvements for future iterations of the competition.
