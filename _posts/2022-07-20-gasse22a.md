title: 'The Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization Competition (ML4CO): Results
  and Insights'
abstract: 'Combinatorial optimization is a well-established area in operations research
  and computer science. Until recently, its methods have focused on solving problem
  instances in isolation, ignoring that they often stem from related data distributions
  in practice. However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine
  learning as a new approach for solving combinatorial problems, either directly as
  solvers or by enhancing exact solvers. Based on this context, the ML4CO aims at
  improving state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization solvers by replacing key heuristic
  components. The competition featured three challenging tasks: finding the best feasible
  solution, producing the tightest optimality certificate, and giving an appropriate
  solver configuration. Three realistic datasets were considered: balanced item placement,
  workload apportionment, and maritime inventory routing. This last dataset was kept
  anonymous for the contestants.'
