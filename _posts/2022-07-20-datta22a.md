title: Exploring Conceptual Soundness with TruLens
abstract: As machine learning has become increasingly ubiquitous, there has been a
  growing need to assess the trustworthiness of learned models. One important aspect
  to model trust is conceptual soundness, i.e., the extent to which a model uses features
  that are appropriate for its intended task. We present <em>TruLens</em>, a new cross-platform
  framework for explaining deep network behavior. In our demonstration, we provide
  an interactive application built on TruLens that we use to explore the conceptual
  soundness of various pre-trained models. We take the unique perspective that robustness
  to small-norm adversarial examples is a necessary condition for conceptual soundness;
  we demonstrate this by comparing explanations on models trained with and without
  a robust objective. Our demonstration will focus on our end-to-end application,
  which will be made accessible for the audience to interact with; but we will also
  provide details on its open-source components, including the TruLens library and
  the code used to train robust networks.
