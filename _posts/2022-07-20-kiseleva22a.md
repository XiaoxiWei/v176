title: 'Interactive Grounded Language Understanding  in a Collaborative Environment:
  IGLU 2021'
abstract: 'Human intelligence has the remarkable ability to quickly adapt to new tasks
  and environments. Starting from a very young age, humans acquire new skills and
  learn how to solve new tasks either by imitating the behavior of others or by following
  provided natural language instructions. To facilitate research in this direction,
  we propose IGLU: Interactive Grounded Language Understanding in a Collaborative
  Environment. The primary goal of the competition is to approach the problem of how
  to build interactive agents that learn to solve a task while provided with grounded
  natural language instructions in a collaborative environment. Understanding the
  complexity of the challenge, we split it into sub-tasks to make it feasible for
  participants.'
