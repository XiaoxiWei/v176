title: Interactive Corpora Visualization for 60 Years of AI Research
abstract: Research in artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for over six decades.
  In that time, it has experienced rich growth, with on and off interest, as researchers
  tackle this problem from different angles using inspiration from various fields.
  However, it is difficult to see an overview of the journey that research in AI has
  taken in its lifespan. We created a visualization we call “60 Years of AI” that
  explores a (biased) selection of the most influential publications that have shaped
  the field. Our visualization shows similar works clustered together throughout time
  and allows users to input abstracts of new ideas to see where their ideas position
  in the landscape of the ever-growing field of AI.
