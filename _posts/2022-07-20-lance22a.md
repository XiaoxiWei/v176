title: 'Multimodal single cell data integration challenge: Results and lessons learned'
abstract: 'Biology has become a data-intensive science. Recent technological advances
  in single-cell genomics have enabled the measurement of multiple facets of cellular
  state, producing datasets with millions of single-cell observations. While these
  data hold great promise for understanding molecular mechanisms in health and disease,
  analysis challenges arising from sparsity, technical and biological variability,
  and high dimensionality of the data hinder the derivation of such mechanistic insights.
  To promote the innovation of algorithms for analysis of multimodal single-cell data,
  we organized a competition at NeurIPS 2021 applying the Common Task Framework to
  multimodal single-cell data integration. For this competition we generated the first
  multimodal benchmarking dataset for single-cell biology and defined three tasks
  in this domain: prediction of missing modalities, aligning modalities, and learning
  a joint representation across modalities. We further specified evaluation metrics
  and developed a cloud-based algorithm evaluation pipeline. Using this setup, 280
  competitors submitted over 2600 proposed solutions within a 3 month period, showcasing
  substantial innovation especially in the modality alignment task. Here, we present
  the results, describe trends of well performing approaches, and discuss challenges
  associated with running the competition.'
