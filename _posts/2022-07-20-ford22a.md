title: 'MEWS: Real-time Social Media Manipulation Detection and Analysis'
abstract: This article presents a beta-version of MEWS (Misinformation Early Warning
  System). It describes the various aspects of the ingestion, manipulation detection,
  and graphing algorithms employed to determine–in near real-time–the relationships
  between social media images as they emerge and spread on social media platforms.
  By combining these various technologies into a single processing pipeline, MEWS
  can identify manipulated media items as they arise and identify when these particular
  items begin trending on individual social media platforms or even across multiple
  platforms. The emergence of a novel manipulation followed by rapid diffusion of
  the manipulated content suggests a disinformation campaign.
