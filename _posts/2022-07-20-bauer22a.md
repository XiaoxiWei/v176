title: 'Real Robot Challenge: A Robotics Competition in the Cloud'
abstract: Dexterous manipulation remains an open problem in robotics. To coordinate
  efforts of the research community towards tackling this problem, we propose a shared
  benchmark. We designed and built robotic platforms that are hosted at the MPI-IS
  and can be accessed remotely. Each platform consists of three robotic fingers that
  are capable of dexterous object manipulation. Users are able to control the platforms
  remotely by submitting code that is executed automatically, akin to a computational
  cluster. Using this setup, i) we host robotics competitions, where teams from anywhere
  in the world access our platforms to tackle challenging tasks ii) we publish the
  datasets collected during these competitions (consisting of hundreds of robot hours),
  and iii) we give researchers access to these platforms for their own projects.
