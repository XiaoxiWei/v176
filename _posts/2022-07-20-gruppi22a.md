title: 'The SenSE Toolkit: A System for Visualization and Explanation of Semantic
  Shift'
abstract: " Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) detection, also known as Semantic Shift,
  is the process of identifying and characterizing variations in language usage across
  different scenarios such as time and domain. It allows us to track the evolution
  of word senses, as well as to understand the difference between the languages used
  by distinct communities. LSC detection is often done by applying a distance measure
  over vectors of two aligned word embedding matrices. In this paper, we present SenSE,
  an interactive semantic shift exploration toolkit that provides visualization and
  explanation of lexical semantic change for an input pair of text sources. Our system
  focuses on showing how the different alignment strategies may affect the output
  of an LSC model as well as on explaining semantic change based on the neighbors
  of a chosen target word, while also extracting examples of sentences where these
  semantic deviations appear. The system runs as a web application (available at \\url{http://sense.mgruppi.me}),
  allowing the audience to interact by configuring the alignment strategies while
  visualizing the results in a web browser."
