title: 'Learning by Doing: Controlling a Dynamical System using Causality, Control,
  and Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: 'Questions in causality, control, and reinforcement learning go beyond the
  classical machine learning task of prediction under i.i.d. observations. Instead,
  these fields consider the problem of learning how to actively perturb a system to
  achieve a certain effect on a response variable. Arguably, they have complementary
  views on the problem: In control, one usually aims to first identify the system
  by excitation strategies to then apply model-based design techniques to control
  the system. In (non-model-based) reinforcement learning, one directly optimizes
  a reward. In causality, one focus is on identifiability of causal structure. We
  believe that combining the different views might create synergies and this competition
  is meant as a first step toward such synergies. The participants had access to observational
  and (offline) interventional data generated by dynamical systems. Track CHEM considers
  an open-loop problem in which a single impulse at the beginning of the dynamics
  can be set, while Track ROBO considers a closed-loop problem in which control variables
  can be set at each time step. The goal in both tracks is to infer controls that
  drive the system to a desired state. Code is open-sourced ( https://github.com/LearningByDoingCompetition/learningbydoing-comp
  ) to reproduce the winning solutions of the competition and to facilitate trying
  out new methods on the competition tasks.'
