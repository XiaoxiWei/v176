title: Insights From the NeurIPS 2021 NetHack Challenge
abstract: In this report, we summarize the takeaways from the first NeurIPS 2021 NetHack
  Challenge. Participants were tasked with developing a program or agent that can
  win (i.e., ’ascend’ in) the popular dungeon-crawler game of NetHack by interacting
  with the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE), a scalable, procedurally generated,
  and challenging Gym environment for reinforcement learning (RL). The challenge showcased
  community-driven progress in AI with many diverse approaches significantly beating
  the previously best results on NetHack. Furthermore, it served as a direct comparison
  between neural (e.g., deep RL) and symbolic AI, as well as hybrid systems, demonstrating
  that on NetHack symbolic bots currently outperform deep RL by a large margin. Lastly,
  no agent got close to winning the game, illustrating NetHack’s suitability as a
  long-term benchmark for AI research.
