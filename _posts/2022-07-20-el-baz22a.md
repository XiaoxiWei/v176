title: 'Lessons learned from the NeurIPS 2021 MetaDL challenge: Backbone fine-tuning
  without episodic meta-learning dominates for few-shot learning image classification'
abstract: Although deep neural networks are capable of achieving performance superior
  to humans on various tasks, they are notorious for requiring large amounts of data
  and computing resources, restricting their success to domains where such resources
  are available. Meta-learning methods can address this problem by transferring knowledge
  from related tasks, thus reducing the amount of data and computing resources needed
  to learn new tasks. We organize the MetaDL competition series, which provide opportunities
  for research groups all over the world to create and experimentally assess new meta-(deep)learning
  solutions for real problems. In this paper, authored collaboratively between the
  competition organizers and the top-ranked participants, we describe the design of
  the competition, the datasets, the best experimental results, as well as the top-ranked
  methods in the NeurIPS 2021 challenge, which attracted 15 active teams who made
  it to the final phase (by outperforming the baseline), making over 100 code submissions
  during the feedback phase. The solutions of the top participants have been open-sourced.
  The lessons learned include that learning good representations is essential for
  effective transfer learning.
