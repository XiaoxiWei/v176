title: Traffic4cast at NeurIPS 2021 - Temporal and Spatial Few-Shot Transfer Learning
  in Gridded Geo-Spatial Processes
abstract: 'The IARAI Traffic4cast competitions at NeurIPS 2019 and 2020 showed that
  neural networks can successfully predict future traffic conditions 1 hour into the
  future on simply aggregated GPS probe data in time and space bins. We thus reinterpreted
  the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-Nets
  proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an ability to extract relevant
  features in this complex real-world geo-spatial process. Building on the previous
  competitions, Traffic4cast 2021 now focuses on the question of model robustness
  and generalizability across time and space. Moving from one city to an entirely
  different city, or moving from pre-COVID times to times after COVID hit the world
  thus introduces a clear domain shift. We thus, for the first time, release data
  featuring such domain shifts. The competition now covers ten cities over 2 years,
  providing data compiled from over $10^{12}$ GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured
  traffic dynamics sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts.
  Surprisingly, this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history
  and static road graph as input. '
