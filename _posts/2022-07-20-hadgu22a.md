title: Lesan – Machine Translation for Low Resource Languages
abstract: Millions of people around the world can not access content on the Web because
  most of the content is not readily available in their language. Machine translation
  (MT) systems have the potential to change this for many languages. Current MT systems
  provide very accurate results for high resource language pairs, e.g., German and
  English. However, for many low resource languages, MT is still under active research.
  The key challenge is lack of datasets to build these systems. We present Lesan (https://lesan.ai/),
  an MT system for low resource languages. Our pipeline solves the key bottleneck
  to low resource MT by leveraging online and offline sources, a custom Optical Character
  Recognition (OCR) system for Ethiopic and an automatic alignment module. The final
  step in the pipeline is a sequence to sequence model that takes parallel corpus
  as input and gives us a translation model. Lesan{’}s translation model is based
  on the Transformer architecture. After constructing a base model, back translation
  is used to leverage monolingual corpora. Currently Lesan supports translation to
  and from Tigrinya, Amharic and English. We perform extensive human evaluation and
  show that Lesan outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as Google Translate and
  Microsoft Translator across all six pairs. Lesan is freely available and has served
  more than 10 million translations so far. At the moment, there are only 217 Tigrinya
  and 15,009 Amharic Wikipedia articles. We believe that Lesan will contribute towards
  democratizing access to the Web through MT for millions of people.
