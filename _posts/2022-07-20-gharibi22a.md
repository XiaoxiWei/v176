title: 'TripleBlind: A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Decentralized Data and Algorithms'
abstract: 'Centralized sharing of sensitive data for training and inference is challenging
  and undesired due to privacy, competition, and legal concerns. While distributed
  learning and secure inference have demonstrated significant privacy gains, these
  methods still largely ignore the design and implementation of practical, privacy-preserving
  tool support. To address these challenges, we present TripleBlind, an automated
  privacy-preserving framework for creating and consuming data-driven applications
  from decentralized data and algorithms. TripleBlind provides a set of automated,
  high-level APIs that enable (1) extracting knowledge from remote data without moving
  it outside the ownerâ€™s infrastructure, (2) training AI models from decentralized
  data, and (3) consuming trained models for secure inference-as-a-service; all without
  compromising the privacy of either the model/query or the data. In this short paper,
  we shed light on the underlying training and inference methods, the design and implementation
  of our framework, and showcase the actual code necessary to run a secure, remote
  inference using our secure multi-party computation API. A video demo highlighting
  the main features of our framework is located at www.tripleblind.ai/neurips2021 '
