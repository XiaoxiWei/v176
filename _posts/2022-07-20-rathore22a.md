title: An Interactive Visual Demo of Bias Mitigation Techniques for Word Representations
  From a Geometric Perspective
abstract: 'Language representations are known to encode and propagate biases, i.e.,
  stereotypical associations between words or groups of words that may cause representational
  harm. In this demo, we utilize interactive visualization to increase the interpretability
  of a number of state-of-the-art techniques that are designed to identify, mitigate,
  and attenuate these biases in word representations, in particular, from a geometric
  perspective. We provide an open source web-based visualization tool and offer hands-on
  experience in exploring the effects of these debiasing techniques on the geometry
  of high-dimensional word vectors. To help understand how various debiasing techniques
  change the underlying geometry, we decompose each technique into modular and interpretable
  sequences of primitive operations, and study their effect on the word vectors using
  dimensionality reduction and interactive visual exploration. This demo is primarily
  designed to aid natural language processing (NLP) practitioners and researchers
  working with fairness and ethics of machine learning systems. It can also be used
  to educate NLP novices in understanding the existence of and then mitigating biases
  in word embeddings. '
