title: 'MineRL Diamond 2021 Competition: Overview, Results, and Lessons Learned'
abstract: Reinforcement learning competitions advance the field by providing appropriate
  scope and support to develop solutions toward a specific problem. To promote the
  development of more broadly applicable methods, organizers need to enforce the use
  of general techniques, the use of sample-efficient methods, and the reproducibility
  of the results. While beneficial for the research community, these restrictions
  come at a cost—increased difficulty. If the barrier for entry is too high, many
  potential participants are demoralized. With this in mind, we hosted the third edition
  of the MineRL ObtainDiamond competition, MineRL Diamond 2021, with a separate track
  in which we permitted any solution to promote the participation of newcomers. With
  this track and more extensive tutorials and support, we saw an increased number
  of submissions. The participants of this easier track were able to obtain a diamond,
  and the participants of the harder track progressed the generalizable solutions
  in the same task.
