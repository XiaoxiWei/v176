title: 'VisDA-2021 Competition: Universal Domain Adaptation to Improve Performance
  on Out-of-Distribution Data'
abstract: Progress in machine learning is typically measured by training and testing
  a model on samples drawn from the same distribution, i.e. the same domain. This
  over-estimates future accuracy on out-of-distribution data. The Visual Domain Adaptation
  (VisDA) 2021 competition tests models’ ability to adapt to novel test distributions
  and handle distributional shift. We set up unsupervised domain adaptation challenges
  for image classifiers and evaluate adaptation to novel viewpoints, backgrounds,
  styles and degradation in quality. Our challenge draws on large-scale publicly available
  datasets but constructs the evaluation across domains, rather than the traditional
  in-domain benchmarking. Furthermore, we focus on the difficult “universal" setting
  where, in addition to input distribution drift, methods encounter missing and/or
  novel classes in the test set. In this paper, we describe the datasets and evaluation
  metrics and highlight similarities across top-performing methods that might point
  to promising future directions in universal domain adaptation research. We hope
  that the competition will encourage further improvement in machine learning methods’
  ability to handle realistic data in many deployment scenarios. http://ai.bu.edu/visda-2021/.
