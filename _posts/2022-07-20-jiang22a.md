title: 'GANs for All: Supporting Fun and Intuitive Exploration of GAN Latent Spaces'
abstract: 'We have developed a new tool that makes it possible for people with zero
  programming experience to intentionally and meaningfully explore the latent space
  of a GAN. We combine a number of methods from the literature into a single system
  that includes multiple functionalities: uploading and locating images in the latent
  space, image generation with text, visual style mixing, and intentional and intuitive
  latent space exploration. This tool was developed to provide a means for designers
  to explore the "design space" of their domains. Our goal was to create a system
  to support novices in gaining a more complete, expert understanding of their domain{â€™}s
  design space by lowering the barrier of entry to using deep generative models in
  creative practice.'
