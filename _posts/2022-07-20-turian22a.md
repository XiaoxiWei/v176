title: 'HEAR: Holistic Evaluation of Audio Representations'
abstract: What audio embedding approach generalizes best to a wide range of downstream
  tasks across a variety of everyday domains without fine-tuning? The aim of the HEAR
  benchmark is to develop a general-purpose audio representation that provides a strong
  basis for learning in a wide variety of tasks and scenarios. HEAR evaluates audio
  representations using a benchmark suite across a variety of domains, including speech,
  environmental sound, and music. HEAR was launched as a NeurIPS 2021 shared challenge.
  In the spirit of shared exchange, each participant submitted an audio embedding
  model following a common API that is general-purpose, open-source, and freely available
  to use. Twenty-nine models by thirteen external teams were evaluated on nineteen
  diverse downstream tasks derived from sixteen datasets. Open evaluation code, submitted
  models and datasets are key contributions, enabling comprehensive and reproducible
  evaluation, as well as previously impossible longitudinal studies. It still remains
  an open question whether one single general-purpose audio representation can perform
  as holistically as the human ear.
